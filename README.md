This is the *My First Project (JavaScript)* project I made myself.

Imagine that you're the owner of a new small corner shop. You are doing well and want to determine how much you earned in the first month. Create a simple tool that will calculate your net income. Upon completing this project, you can use this tool for your own accounting needs.

Here's the link to the project: [https://hyperskill.org/projects/451](https://hyperskill.org/projects/426?track=5)
